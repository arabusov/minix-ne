# MINIX 1.7.5
That was a boring evening when I for the second time tried to
install MINIX on my IBM PS/2 8530-286. And unfortunatelly,
only with version 1.7.5 I could complete the setup program
with pcem (or QEMU?). There were some issues to work with this,
but now after fixing them, it runs almonst fine.
